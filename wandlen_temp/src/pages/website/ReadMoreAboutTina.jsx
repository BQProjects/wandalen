                  Tina grew up on the outskirts of the village of Haarle in
                  Salland, Overijssel. At this hobby farm she was often outside,
                  in the vegetable garden, the meadow, by the pond or the other
                  animals in the yard. She grew up with nature around her. Tina
                  helps both healthcare organizations and government agencies as
                  a process supervisor in greening and connection on the theme
                  of nature &amp; health.&nbsp;

                  Tina comes from a care family. Both her parents worked in the
                  hospital. Her mother as a nurse and her father started in the
                  operating room as an anesthesia assistant and then focused on
                  improving the logistics processes in hospitals in his career.
                  Tina learned from her family how your body works and how to
                  build in peace by listening to your body and connecting with
                  nature. She likes to bring this basic need of man for a
                  natural environment and its influence on your body and mind
                  back to people in this way.

                  Tina has the qualities of an inspiring connector. She uses her

                  mobilizing, optimistic, independent and original. These
                  characteristics have ensured that she has developed this plan
